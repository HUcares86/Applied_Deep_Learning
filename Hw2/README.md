1. dataset.py and multi_test and QA_testing  are for data preprocessing and Multichoice and QA testing
2. multi_choice.py and qa.py are Pretrained for kaggle training 
3. multi_scratch.py and qa_scratch.py are for Not Pretrained

4. to reproduce final_2.csv(kaggle) run multi_choice.py and qa.py weights are in Multichoice_final_2 and QA_final_2

5. to reproduce no_pre_weight.csv run multi_scratch.py and qa_scratch, the weights are in saved_Multi_model_scratch and saved_QA_model_1109_no_pre_weight
